# Realtime Shared MultiThreaded Whiteboard Application using JavaFX and RMI 
## Context
This assignment requires us to develop a Distributed shared whiteboard Java based desktop application. The Application, being shared, enables multiple users to collaborate on a single drawing project. The application is focused on real time sharing of canvas so any action performed by a collaborator on the whiteboard is replicated to the screens of every other person in that project. This whiteboard also features different shapes to choose from, mainly triangle, circle, rectangle and line. Apart from that users can also scribble and write some texts on the canvas. This application also has a chat based system where different users, working on the same project can send texts to the other collaborators. A user management system is also designed which enables the application to track multiple projects at the same time with each project containing multiple collaborators. The multithreading and communication between the collaborators is done through Remote Method Invocation (RMI) which is a thread-safe implementation. Because of RMI, it can support multiple concurrent users and the server is able to handle multiple requests at the same time.
